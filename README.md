# Bunker Bites

# Project Context

Using all of the skills we have developed over the course of the last two trimesters, we developed a design, narrow down what should be in MVP (minimum viable product), and work together as a team to bring the idea to life.

# Project Description

This is a Repo for Holberton Tulsa Hack Sprint. The theme is "Breakfast" so we are making a web site modeled after meal kit delivery services like Hello fresh, Blue Apron, and Home Chef, except our company delivers in a post zombie apocalypse world.
